# MQTT Topic Organization

Topic: Commute Convoying

```markdown
To check current traffic accidents:
- accidents/taiwan/[county]
- accidents/japan/[prefectures]
- accidents/[other countries/regions]/[divisions]

To get a route suggestion based on different index:
- routes/safe
- routes/fast
- routes/balanced

To report an accident:
- accidents/report
```

Since we need to find a safer commute route for children or elders, then I think we can provide two main topics: traffic accidents and routes. One is for checking the current accidents happened in real time, while the other is for finding the best route for commuting them.
